# rescale_IPTp_based_on_dose_trajectory.R

# We have IPTp coverage from DHS, but only up until 2016. We also have data from the PNILP on number of people receiving IPTp in each month and year from 2017 onwards.
#   To project coverage increases after 2016, we look at how number of IPTp treatments increases and rescale accordingly (assuming the 2017 number data represents the 2016 coverage)
